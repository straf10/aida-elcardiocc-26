A cardiologist writes a discharge summary in free-text Greek. Someone then has to read it and
assign the right ICD-10 codes — for the hospital record, for reimbursement, for national health
statistics. It is slow, it is done by hand, and it is easy to miss a diagnosis buried in the
third paragraph.

**ELCardioCC reads the summary and proposes the codes.** Above: the note is digitised, the system
marks the spans it is reacting to, and each one resolves into an ICD-10 code with a confidence
score. The document in the animation is a synthetic example — no real patient text appears
anywhere in this repository (see [DATA.md](data/DATA.md)).

## The task

Given a Greek discharge summary from a cardiology clinic, predict every relevant ICD-10 code.
This is **multi-label** classification over **115 target codes** across 2,500 documents, and it
is hard for reasons specific to this domain:

| Challenge | Why it hurts |
|---|---|
| Greek morphological richness | The same concept surfaces in many inflected forms |
| Code-switching | Latin abbreviations and drug names sit inside Greek sentences |
| Long documents | Summaries exceed the 512-token window of standard encoders |
| Extreme label imbalance | 30 of the 115 codes appear fewer than 10 times in the entire corpus |

Scoring is **group-level micro-F1**: labels are grouped into clinical entities (sets of
synonymous codes), a gold group is satisfied by any one of its members, and over-predicting
within a group counts as false positives.

## Results

Official ELCardioCC 2026 test set:

| Submission | Recall | Precision | **F1** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **ensemble** — `merge_and`: weighted + correction | 0.8510 | 0.8830 | **0.8667** |
| ensemble — `merge_k2`: weighted + per-label + corr. | 0.8687 | 0.8539 | 0.8613 |
| ensemble — safer threshold, `merge_k2` | 0.8767 | 0.8431 | 0.8596 |
| Greek BERT — 100% of the data | 0.8194 | 0.8811 | 0.8491 |
| Greek BERT — 80/10/10 split | 0.8310 | 0.8675 | 0.8489 |

The ensemble beats the best standalone model by **+1.8 points**, and that gap holds up under
testing. A document-level paired bootstrap (10,000 resamples) gives a mean micro-F1 difference of
**+0.0323**, 95% CI `[+0.0212, +0.0437]`, with **zero of 10,000 resamples** favouring the
standalone model. A McNemar test over gold groups recovers **88 groups by the ensemble alone
against 21 by Greek BERT alone** (*p* ≈ 2.6 × 10⁻¹⁰).

Two smaller results worth naming: per-label threshold tuning is worth **+3.7 points** on its own
(0.8062 vs. 0.7693 at a fixed `t = 0.5`), and training Greek BERT on 100% of the data instead of
an 80/10/10 split changes nothing (0.8491 vs. 0.8489) — at this scale the validation split costs
no signal.

## How the system works

Six components, deliberately chosen to fail in different places, fused by a search over
ensemble strategies.

    <img alt="System architecture: a discharge summary is cleaned and split, read independently by Greek BERT, XLM-R Large, XLM-R Base, a dictionary baseline, an IR module and a NER+EL tagger, then reconciled by a metaheuristic ensemble search into ICD-10 codes" src="assets/pipeline-diagram-light.png" width="960">
  </picture>
</p>

Each component brings a different technique to the same text:

| Component | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Greek BERT** — [`src/mlc_greek_bert/`](src/mlc_greek_bert/) | `nlpaueb/bert-base-greek-uncased-v1` with a 2-layer MLP head, **asymmetric loss** for imbalance, layer-wise LR decay, per-label thresholds |
| **XLM-RoBERTa Large / Base** — [`src/xlm_r_large/`](src/xlm_r_large/) · [`src/xlm_r_base/`](src/xlm_r_base/) | Sliding windows for long documents, multi-sample dropout, semantic anchoring against the ICD-10 Greek descriptions |
| **Dictionary baseline** — [`src/dictionary/`](src/dictionary/) | Aho-Corasick automaton over a mined term→code dictionary, plus cardiology procedure and co-occurrence rules |
| **Information retrieval** — [`src/information_retrieval/`](src/information_retrieval/) | BM25 + TF-IDF + dense MiniLM embeddings, fused by Reciprocal Rank Fusion |
| **NER + entity linking** — [`src/ner_el/`](src/ner_el/) | BIO sequence tagger on Greek BERT with a Partial CRF, augmented by Aho-Corasick matching |
| **Metaheuristic ensemble** — [`src/ensemble_metaheuristic/`](src/ensemble_metaheuristic/) | Declarative search over 11 fusion strategies × 3 composition operators, driven by random restarts, hill-climbing and Variable Neighbourhood Search |

## What the errors look like

The headline number hides a split in the label distribution, and this is the most interesting
thing in the project.

**On rare codes, the rule-based components beat every neural model.** Across the 30 codes with
fewer than 10 instances, band-level micro-F1 is roughly **0.62 for the dictionary and NER+EL**
against **0.37 for Greek BERT** and 0.35 for XLM-R Large. On the frequent codes (100–499
instances) the ordering inverts completely — Greek BERT reaches ≈0.92 and the dictionary ≈0.71.
The ensemble, tuned for overall micro-F1, lands at ≈0.39 on the rare band: **it does not recover
the long tail**, it optimises the head. That is the clearest direction for future work.

**Where the codes actually go wrong:**

| Failure mode | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Temporal reasoning | I21 / I22 / I25 (acute MI, subsequent MI, chronic ischaemic disease) co-occur constantly and need reasoning about *when*, which bag-of-token models do not do. I21 is the single largest false-positive source (29). |
| Ubiquitous interventions | Z95 (vascular implants) fires on any stent mention (18 false positives) whether or not the code applies. |
| No lexical surface form | Codes inferred from lab values or implicit multi-sentence evidence — M35, R57 — are never recovered. 31 label types fall entirely outside the dictionary's coverage. |
| Unwritable rare codes | For 10 of the rarest codes there are too few instances for per-label thresholding to apply at all. |

The four analysis figures behind these claims — component F1, frequency bands, top FP/FN, and
the MI confusion cluster — are in [`report/figures/`](report/figures/) and discussed in the
[paper](report/main.pdf).

## Computational cost

Measured on a single run per component; useful mostly for the order-of-magnitude gap.

| Component | Backbone params | Training time |
|---|---:|---|
| XLM-RoBERTa Large | 560M | 2h 14m |
| XLM-RoBERTa Base | 278M | 1h 36m |
| Greek BERT (MLC) | 113M | 15m |
| NER + entity linking | 113M | 3m |
| Information retrieval | — | ≈30s (no training; one-off dense encoding) |
| Dictionary baseline | — | ≈5s (no training; rule construction) |

The ensemble search — 10,000 evaluations × 2 restarts × 2 optimisers — runs in **under 5 minutes
on CPU**, because it operates on cached score matrices rather than raw text. Inference over the
250-document validation set is under a minute for every component.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/straf10/aida-elcardiocc-26.git
cd aida-elcardiocc-26
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.10+. The clinical text is **not** in this repo — obtain it from the task organizers and
place it under `data/raw/` as described in [DATA.md](data/DATA.md).

Every subsystem is a module driven by a YAML config, run from the repository root:

```bash
# 1. clean and flatten the raw JSONL
PYTHONPATH=src python -m preprocessing

# 2. multi-label stratified 80/10/10 split
PYTHONPATH=src python -m split_data --config src/split_data/split.yaml

# 3. train a component (each has its own config)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m mlc_greek_bert.train --config src/mlc_greek_bert/mlc_greek_bert.yaml

# 4. run every trained component over the splits
PYTHONPATH=src python -m evaluation.run_predictions

# 5. search for the best fusion of their outputs
PYTHONPATH=src python -m ensemble_metaheuristic
```

Individual fusion strategies and ablations can be run directly, e.g.
`python -m ensemble_metaheuristic.strategies.weighted_strategy --help` or
`python -m ensemble_metaheuristic.weighted_subset_sweep`.

## Repository layout

```
src/                    one package per component, each with its own YAML config
data/                   labelset, ICD-10 Greek lookup, mined dictionaries, data card (no patient text)
report/                 figures + compiled paper PDF (LaTeX source kept local for now)
assets/                 the pipeline animation
```

Per-component predictions and blind-test submissions (`patient_id` + codes only) are produced
locally by the pipeline but aren't tracked in git — without the non-public dataset they can't be
independently reproduced anyway, so they'd just be repo clutter.

## Data and privacy

The clinical corpus is not redistributable and is not in this repository. What *is* tracked: the
115-code labelset, the ICD-10 Greek description lookup, the mined term→code dictionaries, and split
statistics. Full schema, provenance and split methodology: **[DATA.md](data/DATA.md)**.
